<p>Probably no town in the world has experienced more
dramatic changes in a lifetime, than has the quarry town
of Marble, Colo. and one of the few living persons who
knows the story of each phase of Marble&rsquo;s history is Theresa
Herman Francis. She and her husband, Bill, now
spend only the summers (winters in Tucson, Ariz.) in
the white and green house in Marble that was her year
&rsquo;round home for 33 years.</p>
<p>One of the town&rsquo;s active citizens during the 20&rsquo;s and
30&rsquo;s when the population of Marble numbered in the
thousands, Theresa changed her life very little when
Marble became a ghost town in 1945. Although living
alone in town most of the time, she did not become a
recluse, but remained the same cheerful, energetic, neighborly
person she had always been. By hard work and
ingenious use of materials familiar to her through the
years of teaching arts and crafts in the Marble and other
schools, she established an independent living for herself.
By patiently and accurately answering dozens of questions
thousands of times, and by friendly help to all of
the people who stopped at her roadside stand every
summer, Theresa has made many friends for herself and
for Marble. By her enthusiasm for, and faith in the future
of Marble, she has done more than any other person toward
bringing her beloved town back to life.</p>
<p>Half in fun, half in tribute, Loey Rinquist of Aspen,
Colo. once began a Christmas card to her, &ldquo;Dear Mrs.
Marble.&rdquo; It is &ldquo;Mrs. Marble&rdquo; herself who has written
the story of Marble for you. Her long teaching experience,
and her years of answering questions for tourists,
have prepared her to answer all of your questions, herein
exactly as they have occurred.</p>
<p>This booklet will serve as guide, and be an interesting
and accurate record of your trip through beautiful and
historic Crystal River Valley.</p>

above Hays Creek Falls, nine miles below
Marble. Lower road was the Crystal River &amp; San Juan
railroad bed, converted to a road in 1945. The upper road
(Bunker Hill road) was used for general transportation
prior to this time. Beautiful Chair Mountain, covered with
snow, can be seen in the background.

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">PRELUDE</span></h2>
<p>I came to Marble, Colo. in 1923 while it was still a very active
thriving little city. My first husband, Theodore (Ted) A. Herman,
worked in the marble mill almost twenty years: then after a few
years sickness he died, and I remained a widow over eleven
years, never leaving Marble except for brief visits with relatives.
Many times during these winters I was the only person in town,
yet I was never bored or afraid. The telephone company kept
my phone in good working order and I received my mail three
times a week. I had a good radio, loved to read, write letters,
and do my pyro-plastic work to sell at the stand (Ken&rsquo;s Pop
Stand) during the summers. This stand was started by my grandson,
Kenneth E. Herman, in 1948, as a nestegg for his college
education. When I quit teaching school in 1952, we ran it together
until 1956 when he graduated from South High School
in Denver and felt he must find a more lucrative job. I have run
it alone since.</p>
<p>In late 1956 I married again and now spend my summers in
Marble and winters in Tucson, Ariz., where my husband is a
Linotype operator on a Tucson daily paper. It is our earnest
desire to spend the rest of our lives in Marble after he retires.</p>
<p>In attempting to compile a history of the Crystal River Valley
I have accumulated such a vast amount of interesting material
that it would be impossible to condense it into a booklet of
10,000 words. So I have decided to write a brief history of the
various locales and answer the questions most often asked at the
pop stand. Then after another year or two of research I&rsquo;ll try
to write a book containing a more detailed history and memoirs
of the many interesting people who have lived in the valley, if
I feel the public would like such a volume.</p>
<p>If this little booklet has given you some pleasure and knowledge
of this marvelous valley, then it has accomplished its purpose
and I am happy. I am sure that once you have visited this
portion of the western slope and know its history you will love
it as I do.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>CRYSTAL RIVER SAGA</i></span></h2>
<p>One of the most beautiful rivers in Colorado has its source at
Schofield Pass high above Elko Basin and Schofield Park. It is
fed by melting snow and many crystal clear springs, hence the
name Crystal River. And it does not belie its name, as, excepting
a few weeks in the spring when melting snow along its lower
tributaries gives it a roily turbulent appearance, it is truly crystal
clear.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>SCHOFIELD</i></span>
<br /><i>The Flower Garden of the Rockies</i></h2>
<p class="center">(<i>Elevation Approximately 10,000 feet</i>)</p>
<p>Schofield has been called &ldquo;The flower garden of the Rockies&rdquo;
and rightly so. It is carpetted with multifarious species of flowers,
ranging from the delicate snow flowers and Alpine mosses
through several shades of Indian paint brushes, blue and purple
lupines, and wild roses to the lusty sunflowers. It is especially
beautiful in July and August when there are literally hundreds
of acres of blue, purple, lavender, gold, and brown columbines.</p>
<p>In the early 1870s gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and galina
were found in this region, so naturally a mining camp mushroomed
over night into a village of 50 or 60 houses. These were
the regular camp-style buildings with no foundations, resembling
huge packing boxes. There was also a store, hotel, concentration
mill, and several saloons. While its population sometimes soared
into the thousands, it was a transit, moving people, living mostly
in tents and always looking for better prospects.</p>
<p>Frank Hall&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of Colorado,&rdquo; Vol. IV, page 150, date
1895, has this to say about this mining camp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Schofield was surveyed and platted August 24, 1879, by J. Evans for
a company composed of Daniel Haines, S. H. Baker, B. F. Schofield
(for whom it was named), H. G. Ferris, Wm. Agee, E. D. Baker, A. H.
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Slossen, and G. Edwards. It is located on Rock Creek (now called
Crystal River) between Elko Basin and Crystal City, eight miles northwest
of Gothic, and some 40 miles west of Gunnison. It never was a
camp of much importance, though a central station for a number of
prospectors.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Grant is supposed to have ridden into Schofield on a
white mule when he was campaigning for the U. S. presidency.
Some of the prospectors tried to sell him some mining claims;
being unsuccessful in that, they attempted to get him into a
poker game and lose a claim to him so they could boast, &ldquo;The
President of the United States owns mining property in Schofield.&rdquo;
But they weren&rsquo;t proficient enough in &ldquo;stacking the cards&rdquo;
to deal him a winning hand. Wishing to show him the grandeur
of the canyon they took him where he could look down into the
Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowls and told him it was called the &ldquo;SOB Canyon.&rdquo;
He agreed it was appropriately named but suggested a
name that would be even harder to beat, &ldquo;The Schultz Canyon.&rdquo;
Schultz being his political opponent at the time.</p>
<p>Schofield flourished for 12 or 14 years, then they decided the
cost of transportation was far more than the mineral mined warranted,
so in 1886 practically the entire town was moved down
the valley four miles and Crystal City was started. Schofield
became truly a &ldquo;ghost town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has always been easier to enter Schofield from Crested
Butte than from Crystal, but now with the opening of a jeep
road between Schofield and Crystal City all that has been
changed and today a new Schofield is in the making. This time
it is to be a 40-acre tract of modern buildings containing a 24-housing
unit, a motel, and a store. None of the over-night constructed
mining shacks this time, but modern log cabins built to
withstand the elements at this nearly 10,000 foot elevation.</p>
<p>Leaving Schofield, the Crystal River goes through some of
the most spectacular scenery in the world. It runs down a ravine
50 feet below the road, over boulders, through crevices, always
in a hurry, it plunges over a ledge into the Little Devils Punch
Bowl, then it cascades over another ledge making an impressive
waterfall as it drops into the Big Devils Punch Bowl many feet
below, where it seethes and swirls trying to find a way out to go
on down the canyon.</p>
<p>The trail above the river was used as a wagon road from the
early 1880s to about 1917. John A. Williams drove a team of
mules over it in 1911 hauling supplies for the Williams General
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Store in Crystal. Anton Danni drove a supply wagon over it in
1916. The following item was taken from the <i>Marble Booster</i>
newspaper, Aug. 12, 1916:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Boughton, John J. Walsh, D. E. Dever, and Chas. Sisteg, elected
at a caucus to represent Marble as delegates to the Democratic County
Convention which convened at Gunnison Monday, left here early last
Sunday morning, via Crystal (Schofield Pass) driving (horses) most
of the distance and enjoying a motor ride the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the last authentic accounts of this wagon road being
used I can find; so presume it was closed by rock slides shortly
after this date. Over 40 years passed before this scenic part of
Colorado was again made available to travel, mainly through the
efforts of Gunnison County Commissioner Anton Danni and
his road overseer who made several trips from Schofield to
Crystal City, on foot, to see if it were possible, and feasible, to
open a jeep road. They decided it was and on Aug. 5, 1958, after
many months of hard work, the first jeeps came through from
Crested Butte to Marble. In 1959 they hope to improve the road
enough to permit passenger cars to come down; but no vehicle
without a 4-wheel drive could make the trip up the canyon.</p>
<p>The first group to make the trip over the new road was
composed of the following people:</p>
<table class="center" summary="">

</table>
<p>Leaving the punch bowls the river runs another mile and a
half before the North Fork from Lead King Basin joins it. This
tributary drains another scenic valley. Snowmass Peak (14,077 ft.
El.), Maroon Peak (14,158 ft.) and Hagerman Peak can be seen
in the background. Beautiful trails wind through the various
draws leading to Geneva Lake and the Maroon Belles where
fishing is at its best. This is also a highly mineralized valley:
silver, copper, lead, and zinc predominating. The Copper King,
20th Century, Winchester, El Negroero and half of the Richardson,
all located in this basin, belong to Lee Sperry of the Ragged
Mountain district.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>CRYSTAL, The Miners&rsquo; Ideal Camp</i></span></h2>
<p class="center">(<i>Elevation Approximately 9,000 Feet</i>)</p>
<p>One half mile beyond the junction of the North Fork with
the Crystal River it reaches the little hamlet of Crystal City,
magnificently located in a small dale surrounded by several lofty
peaks: Sheep Mountain, Mineral Point, Crystal Peak, Bear Mountain
(the one covered with tall pines), White House, and Treasure
Peaks. Crystal City was another typical mining town of 70
houses, several general stores, a school house (still standing),
Crystal Club (still standing) and several other saloons, a newspaper&mdash;<i>The
Silver Lance</i> followed by <i>The Crystal River Current</i>
(still standing), a concentration mill and a smelter. The peak of
its population was about 650 inhabitants (some say 2,000). While
a railroad was never completed from Crested Butte, a telegraph
line was installed. John Davisson, now of 855 Elm St., Grand
Junction, Colo., patrolled this line on snowshoes as &ldquo;trouble
shooter&rdquo; during the Winters of 1906-&rsquo;07-&rsquo;08.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>The demonitization of silver in 1893 and the inability to get
adequate means of transportation for lead, zinc, and other ores,
the town of Crystal City was practically depopulated soon after
the turn of the century until 1916. Then it again looked as if
the prospectors&rsquo; dream might come true: the population again
rose to several hundred; the Lead King mine, the Black Queen
mine, and the Sheep Mountain tunnel were reopened; the smelter
and concentration mill were reconditioned; a blacksmith shop,
cook house, and bunk houses were located two miles above
Crystal City on Rock Creek. But by the middle of 1917 everything
again shut down and the people drifted away.</p>
<p>Aug. 25, 1917, <i>Marble Booster</i> newspaper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Crystal mines are in their infancy. It would take a million men a thousand
years to exhaust the hills up that way of their silver, copper, lead
and zinc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many interesting stories are told of the early days in Crystal
City by some of its first settlers. One told by F. W. (Dad) Reyland
was that one wintery day when the snow had drifted above
the doors of many of the buildings, they decided to liven things
up a bit by having a dance. Now the dance hall was one of the
buildings completely covered by snow. So they decided to tunnel
in to the door, making niches in the sides of the tunnel in the
snow every few feet in which to anchor candles to guide the
guests to the dance hall. The dance was a huge success and
stirred the town out of its boredom.</p>
<p>Another was told by one who was working in the Colorado
Trading &amp; Development Co. store at the time. During the
winter months the mail was brought up from Marble by a
carrier on snowshoes, who as a rule could get through with very
little trouble. But once when a very deep feathery snow had
fallen he was unable to get through for over a week. The egg
supply at the store was exhausted; so they decided to send a
man down to try to get some. He made it down all right but
had to wait several days for the snow to crust over before coming
back. Then he carried the case of eggs strapped on his shoulders
the six miles back to Crystal City. In the meantime the price of
eggs soared.</p>
<p>In 1938 Emmet S. Gould of Aspen came to Crystal City looking
for ore to run through a recently purchased mill. He became
interested at once in the area not only for its potential mineral
wealth, but also its wild beauty. He bought several mining claims
and city lots with their cabins.</p>

<p>He made an effort to open the Lucky Boy and the Lead King
mines, but unfortunate circumstances once again kept the mines
from paying.</p>
<p>His daughters, Mrs. Dorothy Tidwell and Mrs. Helen Collins,
and granddaughters, Maxine Fowler and Carolyn Lodge, all of
California, still come with their families and friends, and make
up a part of Crystal City&rsquo;s 20 or 30 summer residents.</p>
<p>The Welcome J. Neals who also own mining claims and a
house in Crystal City, come every year from Mooresville, Ind.,
and bring their friends and relatives for a delightful summer&rsquo;s
vacation where the weather is just right, the scenery unsurpassable,
and the elusive trout waiting to match his skill against
that of the tourist.</p>
<p>Dick CarScadden of Aspen spends his summers in Crystal
City conducting tourists on hiking trips: the food and camping
equipment being carried by huskies.</p>
<p>Just what the future holds for Crystal City, none can say. The
people who own it prefer to keep it as it is, a cool, peaceful
relaxing haven. But with the road over Schofield Pass connecting
Crested Butte with Marble and Carbondale open, and with the
known mineral deposits there, it may again become a thriving
mining center.</p>
<p>The Crystal River continues on its way through its narrow
canyon, sometimes on a level with the highway, sometimes hundreds
of feet below it.</p>
<p>Half way between Crystal City and Marble the river passes
Lizzard Lake, one of the most beautiful in Colorado. It is supposed
to be the crater of an old volcano. It is quite shallow around
the edges for several feet out, then drops abruptly to unknown
depths. The Game &amp; Fish Department keeps it well stocked with
trout and even amateur fishermen can land their legal limit. This
is one of the highly mineralized spots in the valley: gold, silver,
copper, etc.</p>

<p class="center">In a Lovely Glen, named for a Lovely White Calcium Carbonate&mdash;<span class="sc">Marble</span>
<br />(<i>Elevation 7,950 Feet</i>)</p>
<p>The Crystal River next reaches the valley where the town of
Marble is located. The Spanish explorers, Escalante and Dominquez,
may have come into this territory in 1541, but they left
no permanent records. The &ldquo;Forty-Niners&rdquo; were supposed to have
come this far off their beaten trail on their way to California;
gold pans and other mining equipment were found near Prospect
Ranch by Bill Gant who trapped beaver in this valley in 1859.
Benjamin Graham prospected in the Elk Mountains in the early
1860s. These early explorations are legendary and no accurate
information is recorded.</p>
<p>Neither the Ute Indians who silently followed the trails of
mountain sheep, elk, deer, and bear through the parks and meadows,
green with succulent grasses and gay and fragrant with
wild flowers, nor the early prospectors who tramped the mossy
banks of the limpid streams, snaring the sunning trout from their
pebbly beds, tracking the beaver and marten for their warm pelts,
or roaming the mountain peaks in search of precious metals,
realized that the white rock that stood out on precipitous mountain
sides was more valuable than all the animal pelts and
precious metals they sought.</p>
<p>George Yule, a prospector who came into Gunnison County
in 1874, is supposed to have been the first white man to discover
and assume the value of the white marble up Yule Creek which
still bears his name. He was the first elected sheriff of Gunnison
County, served two terms, 1878-&rsquo;82. However he did not prove
up on his claims, and they were taken over by Wm. Wood and
W. D. Parry in 1882.</p>
<p>The first prospectors to attempt a permanent settlement in
the valley were John Mobley and W. F. Mason who located their
settlement east of Carbonate Creek and called it Clarence; and
William Wood and W. D. Parry who made their camp near the
mouth of Yule Creek and named it Marble. When the settlements
reached a population large enough to warrant a post office, it
was located west of Carbonate Creek, and Marble was the name
chosen for it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Sizable amounts of lead and zinc had been discovered in this
treasure vault of the Rockies and the ore was being packed out on
burros to Crested Butte. This being a very slow means of transportation
as well as very expensive, attempts were made to
locate a smelter nearer. Finally in 1897 the Hoffman Smelting
&amp; Reduction Co. built one just across the Crystal River south of
Marble. It ran until 1900.</p>
<p>But the town of Marble did not boom until the value of marble
was fully realized. The first quarry was opened on the east
side of Yule Canyon in 1892 by J. C. Osgood and one block of
marble was taken out at a cost of $1,700 to be sent to the World&rsquo;s
Columbian Exposition (1893) in Chicago. In 1895-97 some blocks
were hauled to Carbondale to be shipped east by freight. But
it was not until the beginning of the 1900s that the Yule Quarry
was opened on the west side of the canyon. Besides the pure
white marble there is a great amount of Colorado cloud marble
(a smoky mottled grain), serpentine (mottled green), pink, blue,
and black (mottled with white and green), found up this canyon.</p>
<p>About this same time two more quarries were opened on the
east side of Yule Canyon: the Strauss, by a company of eastern
stockholders who built the broad gauge Strauss railroad from
Marble to the foot of their quarry on Treasure Mountain; and
the White Marble Co. owned by the Mormon Church. While all
the development work was completed, no commercial work was
ever done by either company and the railroad was never used.</p>
<p>In 1905 a road was cut out on the west side of the canyon and
Yule Quarry was started. At first they hauled the marble out on
burro pack trains which unloaded their burden in Marble and
proceeded seven miles to the Placita mines where they were
loaded with coal to be delivered and used at the quarry. There
were two of these trains, each composed of 40 burros; one was
in the charge of Walter Webb, the other was handled by John
Davisson.</p>
<p>Mr. Davisson told me of the above incident; also told another
good tale about the early days in Marble. It seems they had a
town marshal by the name of Schuyler Hodson who stood &ldquo;ace-high&rdquo;
with the workmen. Whenever they imbibed a little too
freely and became troublesome, he didn&rsquo;t throw them in jail
but tried to get them to go home peaceably and sober up. If
they refused to do this, he would take off his badge and gun,
and giving them a good thrashing until they agreed to do as he
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The following is a copy of a letter received from Mr.
Davisson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">855 Elm Street, Grand Junction, Colo.</span>
<span class="lr">Oct. 14, 1958</span></p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Francis,</p>
<p>In reply to yours of Oct. 10th. I had charge of the telegraph line from
Crystal to Crested Butte from 1906 to 1908 inclusive.</p>
<p>I ran the jack train from 1905 until 1908. It might interest you to know
I packed a 6-hole range to the top of Whitehouse Mountain; had two
jacks, 2&times;6 timbers lashed to the saddles and the stove in between. It
was a zigzag trail and it took three men to turn the jacks on each turn.
They said it couldn&rsquo;t be done, but we did it.</p>
<p>I am sending you a list of some of the old timers and what they did.
You might want to use some of it. I have forgotten a lot of them; after
all it was over fifty years ago.</p>

pipelines were run into the plant: one from Crystal River, one
from Yule Creek, and the other down Lost Trail Creek. They
installed a transformer house half way up to the quarry to convert
electricity from direct to alternating current. High tension
lines were run to the mill and to the quarry, and all the company
houses were wired for electricity. Upon the completion of all
this, work was really in production.</p>
<p>It took the trained mind of an engineer, Commodore A. J.
Mitchell, to see value in the calcium carbonate (marble) deposits
that had taken eons to form and place in such a position that
man could extract large blocks from their beds; it took the indominable
courage and optimism of a man like Col. C. F. Meek
to see the possibilities of developing an industry that would
make Colorado famous; it took the foresight and energy of the
promoter, the engineer, and the mechanic; it took the architect,
Harry Bacon, to see the possibilities of erecting a monument
of the translucent white marble from the Yule quarries to the
memory of the great statesman, Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>During the years 1908-16 Marble was really a lively little
city. It boasted five general stores, a drug store, a drygoods
store, two hotels, two large school buildings, two barber shops,
two weekly papers&mdash;<i>The Marble City Times</i> and <i>The Marble
Booster</i>&mdash;picture show, Masonic Hall, two pool halls, and six
saloons. I have talked to many of the really &ldquo;old timers&rdquo; about
the probable population at that time, and the number varies
from 1,500 to nearly 10,000. According to the &ldquo;Company News&rdquo;
column printed each week in the <i>Marble Booster</i> newspaper the
pay roll varied from 700 to 850 names. So taking into consideration
the number of women and children who must have been
here, the population could easily have been several thousand.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 20, 1912, a big snow slide came
down Mill Mountain. As it occurred after the night shift had
gone home and before the day shift had come to work, no lives
were lost but the property damage was very heavy. The <i>Marble
Booster</i> newspaper in writing about the slide had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;While the slide was very bad, so well had the cleaning up and repair
work been done, that within three days every worker was again plying
his trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Marble Booster</i>, Sept. 14, 1912:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center">BAD SMASH ON TROLLEY
<br />Four Persons Meet Death as Result of Runaway Train on the Highline</p>
<p>Four persons met death as a result of an accident on the trolley line
here last Friday a few minutes before noon.</p>
<p>The dead are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><span class="sc">George Healy</span>, motorman of the train.</dt>
<dt><span class="sc">Robert P. Lytle</span>, a brakeman.</dt>
<dt><span class="sc">Atansio Negrete</span>, a Mexican passenger.</dt>
<dt><span class="sc">Mary Tonko</span>, a Polish girl.</dt></dl>
<p>In some manner Healy, the motorman, lost control of a heavily loaded
train at a point on the line near the old smelter, half a mile from the
yard at the mill. Doubtless the airbrakes failed to work. Before the
hand brakes could be set the train attained a frightful speed. W. C.
Goodwin, a mill employee who was riding on the train, jumped and
landed without a scratch. The others stayed on the train.</p>
<p>Just before reaching the bridge over the Crystal River two of the cars
in the train left the track and smashed into a rock cliff at the side of
the track. Lytle, the brakeman, was on one of these cars. He was thrown
with terrible force into the face of the cliff and death was mercifully
quick.</p>
<p>Healy, the motorman, stayed with the balance of the train, as did the
Mexican and the little girl. The runaway cars held the track until the
turn at the loading station in the yards, when everything turned over
on the curve and smashed into splinters. Healy was caught beneath
a huge block of marble and was crushed to death. He probably never
knew what struck him. The Mexican was slammed onto the ground
with such force that death was instantaneous. The little girl, eight years
old, was alive when rescuers reached the scene and was hurried to the
hospital. She died at six o&rsquo;clock that evening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Col. C. F. Meek owned controlling interest in the Colorado
Yule Marble Co. composed of stockholders from Philadelphia and
other eastern cities, and was the president and general manager.
Knowing how to handle men as well as finances he was very
popular with the company employees. Under his management
orders came pouring in and soon Colorado Yule marble was
being used all over the United States: From Houston, Tex. to
Chicago, Ill.; from Washington, D. C., and New York City to
Portland, Ore., Los Angeles and San Francisco, Calif.</p>

<p>Col. Meek especially loved his home and family, and managed
to spend much time with them regardless of other interests.
In addition to being a good manager he was very liberal and
considerate of his employees and the town in general. Although
a Protestant himself he did donate two lots on Park Avenue to
the Catholic Church and was donating marble with which to
erect the building, the company employees were donating their
labor. The corner stone was laid Oct. 12, 1912, and the church
was named &ldquo;Saint Columbus Catholic Church of Marble.&rdquo; Father
Carrigan of Glenwood Springs officiated at the dedication. Father
was a personal friend of Col. Meek and was always entertained
at his home on his visits to Marble. He often said the colonel
was the best read man he ever knew, always being interested
in literature, music, and art, and could converse intelligently on
all subjects. The colonel was seriously injured August 10, 1912,
on a runaway trolley car coming down from the quarry and died
four days later. The new management, not being quite so liberal,
would not donate the marble to complete the building so work
stopped. After a few years a small wooden structure was built
on the front half of the foundation, but green lumber was used
and it was poorly constructed; so after a few years it sagged,
was condemned, and taken down in 1924. But the marble foundation
still stands, a memorial to one of the greatest philanthropists
Marble ever had.</p>
<p>J. F. Manning was elected president and general manager
of the company Oct. 1, 1913. While he was still eastern sales
agent for the company he learned that a memorial to the memory
of Abraham Lincoln was to be built in Washington, D. C., and
went after the contract. This took considerable doing as samples
of marble from all over the world were being sent to Washington.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To determine the question, whether or not this marble was artistically
superior to others, Secretary Garrison referred the matter to the
National Fine Arts Commission, which on January 22, 1914 reported
as following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Commission of Fine Arts at their meeting held today, gave
careful consideration to your letter of Jan. 17, 1914, requesting their
advice upon certain questions arising in connection with the selection
of marble suitable for the construction of the Lincoln Memorial. The
Commission made a careful inspection of all samples submitted and
have the honor to transmit the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The artistic qualities of Colorado Yule marble as compared with
others submitted, in the opinion of the Commission of Fine Arts, fit it
pre-eminently for a structure of the character of the Lincoln Memorial.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>

<p>The contract for the Lincoln Memorial was obtained March
10, 1914, and was to be completed in two years. It was finished
late in 1915, several months ahead of time. During this time
several other large buildings were also completed. (See listing
of buildings made of Colorado marble. pp. <a href="#Page_46">46</a> &amp; <a href="#Page_47">47</a>.)</p>
<p>The following information was obtained from &ldquo;A Statement
to the Stockholders of the Colorado Yule Marble Company by
J. F. Manning&rdquo;:</p>
<p>World conditions in 1916 coupled with the huge indebtedness
accumulated when opening the quarry, building the mill, buying
the necessary machinery, building and equipping the power
house, extending the railroad from Placita to Marble, and the
vast amount of accrued interest, put the company in very bad
financial straits. Then World War I coming on, contracts could
not be obtained, so the Colorado Yule Marble Co. went into the
hands of a receiver July 16, 1916, and remained closed until
April, 1922.</p>
<p>The property was then divided into four parts: the mill, the
quarry, the power house, and the railroad. Eventually it was
put up for sale and was bought by different parties all interested
in one thing, forming one company and putting it on a paying
basis. Through the efforts of Commodore A. J. Mitchell the
Carrara Yule Marble Company was formed and work was resumed
in 1922. On July 24, 1924 the Colorado Consolidated Yule
Marble Co. (CCYMC) was formed and was again put up for sale.</p>
<p>On November 18, 1924, Mr. J. B. Jones of the Gray-Knox
Marble Co. of Knoxville, Tenn., purchased the stock of the
CCYMC and leased the Crystal River &amp; San Juan Railroad with
option to buy. Then the name was changed again; this time to
Tennessee-Colorado Marble Co., and as such was operated until
July 2, 1926, at which time arrangements were made to return
the plant and properties to the CCYMC.</p>
<p>This reversion was brought about in a large measure due to
the fact that the fabricating plant was partially destroyed by
fire April 6, 1926. The loss in machinery and equipment in shops
Nos. 3 and 4, and mill B, together with the building was appraised
at sound value by disinterested engineers at approximately
$531,000.00.</p>
<p>About half of the part destroyed was immediately rebuilt
and operations to complete their contracts were resumed.</p>
<p>On December 20, 1927, a rental lease and purchase agreement
was made between the company and Mr. Jacob F. Smith of New
York and a little later he sold to the Vermont Marble Co. who
(to this date, 1959) still own the quarry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>While the City of Marble never reached its former status, it
was a thriving place, employing several hundred men and marble
was once again being shipped to all parts of the United States.</p>
<p>The contract for the block of marble suitable for the tomb
of the Unknown Soldier was obtained in 1930, and the largest
block of marble (100 tons) ever quarried in the world was cut
out early in 1931. It was moved out onto the floor of the quarry
and sawed down to specifications, 56 tons plus one ton to be
taken off in the finishing. It was lowered down the tramway
guided by huge cranes, to the trolley track at the foot of the
mountain. Then with one trolley in front (Elmer Bair, motorman)
and another behind (Johnny Fenton, motorman) weighted
and tied together, it was skidded on the rails down to the mill;
taking three days to go the 3.9 miles, arriving at the mill February
3, 1931. Special night and day guards to prevent souvenir
hunters from chipping it for momentoes, were stationed near the
block the four days it was in the yard. Then it was placed on
a flat car, crated, braced and started on its way to Proctor, Vermont.
There it was trued to perfection with surveyor&rsquo;s instruments
and sent to Arlington Cemetery, Washington, D. C., where
the company sculptors carved the designs on it.</p>
<p>The Vermont Marble Co.&rsquo;s branch, Colorado Yule Marble Co.,
continued to operate both the quarry and the mill until the
rumblings of World War II, 1941 were being heard. Some of the
employees were going back to Europe, some were volunteering
to go into the service here in the United States, all steel was
going into defense, and contracts could not be obtained, so there
was nothing to do but close down again.</p>
<p>August 9, 1941 was a hot sultry day, dark ominous clouds
covered the heavens, and a few big drops of rain began to fall.
There were several deafening claps of thunder and zigzagging
streaks of lightning crossed the sky. Then it all seemed to pass
away. I was going about my work as usual when one of my
neighbors, Mrs. George T. Harris (nee Anna Reheuser) hurried
through the back door. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Herman,&rdquo; she screamed,
&ldquo;the town is being washed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on with you,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t even raining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking, there&rsquo;s been a cloudburst up Carbonate Creek
and the whole town is being washed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cloud had burst about three miles up the canyon and
the water had backed up behind some beaver dams and log
jams which had been unable to withstand the pressure and it
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
had all come down at one time, cutting a swath a block wide
through the entire town, north to south, to the Crystal River.
The property damage was heavy, but no lives were lost.</p>
<p>Another cloudburst occurred July 31, 1945, in very much
the same way and approximately at the same time of day. While
this one did carry more water and spread over a greater area,
the damage had been done four years previous, so we didn&rsquo;t feel
so badly about it.</p>
<p>The mill closed November 15, 1941, and the last payday at
the quarry was January 15, 1942. The company had decided that
this time instead of keeping caretakers here to look after their
property, they would sell everything but the quarry, and when
conditions warranted their reopening they would come with new
buildings and new machinery and do things the modern way
instead of as they were done when the quarry first opened in
1906.</p>
<p>The marble scattered along the right-of-way between Marble
and Carbondale are not the result of railroad cars overturning,
but were deliberately placed there as ballast to prevent the river
undermining the tracks. They are mostly the trimmings cut from
building blocks, and the larger pieces are rejects, pieces with
fissures, points of flint, or streaks of lime in them.</p>
<p>The single grave two miles below Marble to the left going
out, is that of John C. McKee who contracted pneumonia in
Schofield. His friends, thinking he just had a severe cold, were
attempting to take him on horseback to a doctor in Carbondale.
There was no road between Marble and Carbondale at that
time, just a horse trail. He died when nearing Marble. It being
a hot day and realizing they couldn&rsquo;t possibly reach Carbondale
for two more days, they decided it best to bury him there.</p>
<p>The little cemetery farther down the road to the east was
not there at that time. It was started much later. Many ask if
there had been an epidemic here at one time: so many baby
graves. No, according to the oldest residents of Marble there had
never been an epidemic here to their knowledge. The many infant
graves there belonged to foreigners who considered childbirth
an every day occurrence and no necessity for calling a doctor.
So the infant mortality was very high.</p>
<p>The huge piles of marble near town are not rejects, neither
were they washed there by floods. Marble doesn&rsquo;t wash; and
the floods never came near them. They are the old stock yards
where marble was stored until needed in the mill.</p>

<p>The tall marble columns in the mill yard are not supports

<p>Elmer Bair is another person who has great faith in the valley.
He went to work for the Colorado Yule Marble Co. in 1927 as
a sawyer; after six months he was given the job as motorman on
one of the trolleys. He held this position for four years&mdash;excepting
the winters of 1929 and 1930 when he carried the mail on
snowshoes and skis up to the mines on Schofield Pass.</p>
<p>Quoting from a letter received from Elmer Bair:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The year the company purchased the electric snowplow Bus Long
was the motorman and he was afraid to come off the hill with the big
plow so it was left standing on the side track until mid-winter and
the road was snowed in. The company asked Pop Sampson to open the
road. He took the car crew and 12 other men with shovels to go get
it out. I was one of the 12. When we got there and shoveled out the
plow and side track, Pop asked me if I would run the fan on the plow.
Everyone was tense and excited. The motorman most of all. The plow
had never been tried out and no one knew whether the brakes would
hold or not; and the road between the quarry and the town was known
to be the &lsquo;steepest, slickest, smoothest railroad in the world.&rsquo; Captain
Bill Hafner showed me an article in a magazine called Rock of Ages,
published somewhere in the east, making that assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got along pretty well until we got on top of the hill at the rotary
station, the motors were warmed up, the brakes were hot, and everything
in excellent shape if we had only kept coming down. But the
hill looked pretty steep and the motorman welcomed a chance to relax;
so we all went into the station, ate our lunch, and rested about an hour.
The plow was chained to the rail and the brakes were set, so we were
sure everything was alright. We stayed just long enough for those hot
brakes and wheels to form ice and freeze hard. I started the fan and
Long unchained the plow and started releasing the air a little at a time
until the air was all gone or released, and there we stood on the brow
of that steep hill. The grade immediately ahead was 17 per cent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bus next applied one notch of electricity, or juice, as we called it. It
just stood there and hummed. Then he gave it two notches, and it still
hummed. He then applied three notches and it broke loose&mdash;all at once!
And we were over the hill at a fast speed. Being excited the motorman
applied all the brakes we had, and set all the wheels. We were in a
dangerous runaway; the outfit completely out of control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was only one door and that was on the uphill side. Pop gave
orders to jump to save our lives, and he led the way. As one would get
ready to jump&mdash;a tree, or a trolley pole, or a ledge would show up
right in the face of the one trying to find a space wide enough to
make a safe landing. The snow was deep and jumping at that rate
of speed made some comical sights; some landing on others and rolling
down the hill together. I, having a greater sense of humor than
good common sense, was having the laugh of my life until only two
of us remained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bus was like a chicken with its head off, running from his controls in
front, to the door in the middle of the car. He, being the motorman
naturally wanted to be the last man off. He yelled in my ear and
said, &lsquo;Hurry up and jump, so I can.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Go ahead and jump. No-one
is holding you.&rsquo; I was having too much fun to miss seeing him
take his spill. Each jump was more comical on account of the increased
speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I was left alone in this mad race that looked as if it might end in
death, I began to see the more serious side of things and decided it
was time for me to act in some way to save myself. The least I could
do before making my exit would be to shut off the motor that ran
the fan. After doing so the snow, not being able to go through the
plow, began to pile up in front; within seconds the snow was piled
high as the plow and the speed began to slacken off. No one but me,
will ever know the feeling of comfort and relief that came over me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Sampson and the boys came running&mdash;some limping&mdash;down the
track, expecting to find me and the plow piled at the bottom of the
hill, instead there I sat with my feet hanging out the door, still laughing.
They did not know that there had been a spell of soberness between
then and the time they had left me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bus Long was through being motorman and I was drafted to that
position. After I quit in the fall of 1931, Frank Morse, who had been
continuously with the company through all their operations, told me
I was the only motorman who had run the trolley car any length of
time without having at least one crackup in a runaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the big marble block for the tomb of the Unknown Soldier
was taken out, there were two motormen who brought it down. I was
the head motorman hooked to the front, and Johnny Fenton was
hooked on the back with his motor.&rdquo;

<p>Elmer Bair left the company employment Sept. 30, 1931, and
leased all the company&rsquo;s range land and ran sheep in 1932. He
purchased the Chidester, Cookman, Barnes, and Baroni places&mdash;approximately
1,000 acres&mdash;in 1935. And in 1952 he bought
approximately 1,700 acres from the company and now runs 2,100
sheep in this area every summer.</p>
<p>Our tourists with very few exceptions are awed and thrilled
by our magnificent scenery. George Rosenberg, managing editor
of the <i>Tucson Daily Citizen</i>, Tucson, Ariz. is no exception. He
and his family vacationed in Marble and Carbondale for the
first time in 1958. His enthusiasm for Marble is recorded in a
story with pictures, he published in the <i>Citizen</i>, Aug. 2, 1958,
where he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t taken your vacation yet, and if you think you can talk
the little monsters out of going back to Disneyland ... if either of
these shoes fits, then take my advice ... head for the Hills of Marble.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Chapman, dramatic critic (New York <i>Daily News</i>),
whose hobby is vacation travel, wandered through some ghost
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
towns in his native state of Colorado, took pictures, and wrote
an article extolling the grandeur of the Crystal River Valley.
This article together with colored pictures appeared in <i>Sports
Illustrated</i>, Oct. 7, 1957.</p>
<p>Mrs. Robert J. Hall is another short story writer who visited
in Marble in the fall of 1958. She wrote an article which appeared
in the <i>Weekly Star Farmer</i>, Kansas City, Mo., Jan. 21, 1959, describing
the beauty and resources of the Crystal River Valley in
general and Marble in particular.</p>
<p>After the Vermont Marble Co. pulled out, things were rather
dull for a few years, then it began to forge ahead as a tourist
attraction. Good fishing and hunting, a delightful summer climate,
and scenery that can not be duplicated, bring in more and
more people every year and it is fast becoming one of the better
resort sections of the western slope. It is often referred to as
&ldquo;The Swiss Alps of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At present Beaver Lake Lodge and Cabins owned and operated
by the Wade C. Loudermilks, formerly of Buckeye, Ariz.,
is the only tourist accommodation in Marble. But once a person
stays in the clean, modern cabins or partakes of the delicious
meals served in the lodge, he is sure to return again and again.
Other popular services of the lodge are their horse and jeep tours
(operated as an insured common carrier) to the various mountain
tops of 12,000 feet or more, and the licensed guided pack
trips into the wilderness areas.</p>

<p>The Loudermilks and the Frank Rehs, formerly of Washington,
D. C., now of Glenwood Springs, Colo., are undertaking a
vast land development (700 acres) two miles below Marble
paralleling the Crystal River. This is primarily a subdivision for
home sites, consisting of approximately 75 tracts that have been
surveyed and filed with the Gunnison County recorder. Part of
their program calls for an airstrip 5,200 feet long (3,800 feet now
completed) and a small business district consisting of hangars,
gas pumps, restaurant, curio shop, et cetera.</p>
<p>The Basic Chemical Corporation was organized by Carl Morse
in the early 1950s. They bought the Old (Marble) Mill Site from
Elmer Bair and installed a rock crusher, intending to make a
number of products from the marble left there by the Vermont
Co. These were to include marble chips for roofs, smaller pieces
for macadam and cement work, chicken grits, dust for strengthening
and whitening plaster, and fertilizer for sweeting sour
ground.</p>
<p>This was not as successful as it was hoped it would be, and
was leased to Vance Baker of Grand Junction in 1957. He now
runs it during the summer months and confines most of the work
to the making of marble chips. He expects to enlarge his operations
to the point where he can cut and sell building blocks,
using the trimmings for chips.</p>
<p>The Crystal River flows on down the valley another 3&frac12; miles
through Prospect Ranch, once a part of the Osgood Estate of
Redstone, purchased from it by the Darien Brothers&mdash;Henry,
James, and Gus. Now it is a popular summer resort, Prospect
Ranch Cabins, owned by Jim and Gus Darien and run by the
Gus Dariens of Carbondale.</p>
<p>Any article or series of articles treating of the advantages of
the Crystal River Valley as a vacationing playground would not
be complete without mentioning one of the prettiest camping
and fishing spots in the state, Bogan Flats&mdash;located five miles
below Marble. The Forestry Department supplies the tables,
seats, fireplaces, and restrooms. There are many quiet nooks in
the river where the ingenious trout lurks and seldom does any
fisherman go away empty-handed.</p>
<p>Next, the river flows through Chair Mountain Ranch, also
once a part of the Osgood Estate. The Earl Z. McCullys bought
it from Mrs. Lucille Osgood McDonald in 1943, had it ready to
open as a guest ranch in 1947, and ran it as such until the fall
of 1952 when they sold it to the Ray Somers of Mountain View,
Calif., and Mr. and Mrs. (formerly Mrs. Lola Kemp) C. H.
Patterson of Farmington, N. Mex.</p>

<p>One evening several of us from this neighborhood were spending
a social evening together discussing the various escapades
pulled by dude guests. One in particular seemed especially
amusing: When the McCullys were still running the ranch, a
number of their guests wanted to go for a long horseback ride up
in the mountains. &ldquo;Should you become lost,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;just
tie the reins, drop them on the horses&rsquo; necks, and give them their
heads; they&rsquo;ll come home all right.&rdquo; Sure enough they became
lost, so dismounted and did as Mr. McCully had instructed them
to do. The horses returned to the ranch all right&mdash;riderless.
It took the McCullys several hours to find the guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we shouldn&rsquo;t laugh at dudes, no matter how green,&rdquo;
said Lola, &ldquo;when we first bought the place we were the greenest
dudes on the ranch. Didn&rsquo;t even know which side of a horse to
mount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, they have learned, and Chair Mountain Ranch is
now a very popular, well managed resort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The river flows on to Cleveholm, the famous Redstone castle,
built in 1903 by J. C. Osgood for his first wife, the &ldquo;Lady Bountiful&rdquo;
of Redstone. Every Christmas all the children in the village
were urged to write letters to Santa Claus. They were
delivered to Mrs. Osgood and she personally saw to it that every
child received what she or he asked for; not a cheap, shoddy toy,
but the very best money could buy.</p>
<p>One Christmas the school was giving a program and Christmas
tree, to which all the people in Redstone had been invited.
Right at the height of the festivities the wax candles on the tree
set fire to the cedar branches. Some of the men quickly grabbed
the tree and threw it through one of the windows, thus averting
what might have been a terrible catastrophe. The parents
were very grateful for the presence of mind and quick action
of the men; the children were very downcast that their carefully
planned and often rehearsed program had been so rudely interrupted
and their beautiful Christmas tree ruined.</p>
<p>The next year when Mr. Osgood had a firehouse built it
was located on a lot adjoining the school house grounds.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Cleveholm was patterned after an old English castle. It originally
contained 26 rooms, each with an immense fireplace. The
wall coverings, upholstering, and covers for the bookcases and
reading tables in the library were hand-tooled elephant hide.
Light green silk brocade was used for wall coverings, drapes, and
upholstering in the music room. Dark maroon plush decorated
the walls in the dining room, and all the wood work and furniture
were mahogany. The parlor is an especially large room, two
full stories high on the inside, and lavishly furnished. It also
contained the famous Osgood coat-of-arms.</p>
<p>The tourist court across the river and highway from Cleveholm
is Swiss Village Resort owned by the Olyn Parkers of Denton,
Tex. It was originally the game-keeper&rsquo;s house. They bought
it in 1949 and have added cabins and improvements every year
since then.</p>
<p>The Parkers had spent several summers in various parts of
Colorado and had fallen in love with the majestic rugged scenery,
the clear fresh air, and the peace and quiet found along
the mountain streams away from the city. The idea of having
a summer haven in Colorado grew on them until they began
corresponding with real estate men in different sections of the
state.</p>
<p>Irvin Jarvis, Glenwood Springs, Colo. wrote them that he
believed he had just the place they were looking for&mdash;his summer
home above Redstone. They were interested and arranged
to meet him and his wife there on June 8, 1948. It was love at
first sight, just the place they were looking for&mdash;a place away
from the city, in the beautiful high mountain country, the sparkling
Crystal River flowing just across the road, tall majestic
evergreen trees and lovely aspen gracing the scenery, and many
deer, elk, bear and other animals roaming the mountains. Needless
to say they bought the place.</p>
<p>The house and barn are of Swiss architecture, built in
1901 and were originally a part of the John C. Osgood estate.
The gamekeeper, William Keir, lived here with his family and
looked after the private herds of deer, elk, and mountain sheep.
Much of the high fence and original posts which enclosed many
acres as pasture for these wild animals, are still standing.</p>
<p>Two of the Keir daughters visited the Parkers and related
many interesting anecdotes concerning the early life of the game
park. One deer they had tamed and named Dolly. She would
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
often jump the high fence and follow them to school. Then it
would be their pleasant duty to skip school and take Dolly back
home.</p>
<p>Quoting from a letter received from Mrs. Parker, Jan. 19,
1959:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We started building cabins in 1949 and called our place Swiss Village
Resort. Many nice guests came our way that first summer and stayed
in our cabins. Since then many people&mdash;and they are such lovely
people&mdash;have come our way and happy are the memories of their
laughter ringing out over the place in summers and falls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We derive genuine pleasure in seeing our guests happy. Most of them
are people who love a quiet vacation away from cities, close to nature.
Many enjoy riding into the high country to see nature at its best. So
very many enjoy fishing while others like to ride, hike, rest, or play
games. All of them, the same as we, love to hear the early history of
Redstone, which is most interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fond are our memories of gatherings in the living room in front of a
roaring fire in the huge fireplace listening to the guests tell of the big
fish that got away, or the hunters tell of their day&rsquo;s experiences in
getting their elk, deer or bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our fondest wish is to keep Redstone and the surrounding area always
a place where people like to return year after year, and that God will
grant us many more years to live in this lovely spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we love Redstone and to us the area in and near there is some
of the most beautiful country we have ever seen. As we view the
majestic, awe inspiring handiwork of God we feel very humble and
grateful, and humbly say, &lsquo;Thank you God, for the privilege of seeing
and living in this lovely spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most sincerely,&rdquo;

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>REDSTONE, One Man&rsquo;s Dream</i></span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">of an Ideal Village for Miners</span>
<br />(<i>Elevation Approximately 6,500 feet</i>)</p>
<p>John C. Osgood came to Colorado in the early 1880s to make
a thorough investigation of all the coal deposits in the state.
Those up Coal Creek, a branch of the Crystal River, seemed
especially favorable for his plan, and he was able to buy them
from their original owners for a few hundred dollars. The dream
he had of building a model village for miners in this valley did
not materialize for almost twenty years. He organized the Colorado
Fuel Co. and later acquired the Colorado Coal &amp; Iron Co.
and merged them into one&mdash;Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Co. (CF&amp;I)&mdash;and
was its first president. Then he set out to carry through
his dream and built Redstone, a model village of 40 workmen&rsquo;s
cottages (each styled and painted differently), a modern 40-roomed
inn, a school house, a club house, and a library; all
electrically lighted and as modern as they could be made at
that time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Every workman was given the opportunity of joining the club
and making use of the club rooms. Every member had his own
locker and was urged to come there after work and bathe or
shower, and change into clean clothes before appearing on the
street. They elected their own officers and made their own
rules; one of which was especially good&mdash;treating was not permissible.</p>
<p>The mines were up Coal Creek about 12 miles. There the
miners had their own little village in which they took great pride,
vieing with Redstone as to neatness and gardening.</p>
<p>All the buildings in this model village were constructed to
last, nothing of the overnight box-car type. Yet all this came to
an end in less than a decade. Rumor has it that Mr. Osgood
became too ambitious: he tried to &ldquo;buck&rdquo; John D. Rockefeller
and J. P. Morgan. He ran out of millions; they didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The scenic grandeur of the Crystal River cannot be excelled;
sometimes narrow canyons, precipitous cliffs and steep waterfalls;
sometimes broad valleys heavily wooded with stately ponderosa
pine, Engelmann spruce, Colorado green spruce, blue
spruce, Douglas fir, the narrow leaf cottonwood, and the quaking
aspen; carpeted with waist high ferns, Oregon grapes, and kinnikinnick
(sometimes called Indian tobacco) interspersed with
brilliant flowers of every hue, and often rare plants found only
in much warmer climes. The reason? Perhaps they are remnants
of earlier geological ages; perchance the great combination and
variety of rainfall, heat and cold, shade and sunshine, and slope
exposure have their influences.</p>
<p>The natural resources are unsurpassable. It is an often stated
fact that the Crystal River area from Schofield to Redstone bears
the heaviest concentration of known minerals in the United States.
Millions of dollars worth of coal deposits, undeveloped; billions
of dollars worth of pure white marble waiting to be made into
buildings, memorials, and statuaries; gold, silver, copper, lead
and zinc deposits that haven&rsquo;t been scratched. Yes, Mother Nature
has been very generous in this fabulous valley.</p>
<p>In its Aug. 25, 1917 issue the <i>Marble Booster</i> had this to say
just before it permanently closed its doors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Some day this valley will come into its own. Nature has certainly been
very bountiful in its distribution of resources up and down the Crystal
River Valley, but man has been lame, mighty lame, in developing the
same. The right man may yet come along. Speed the day is our fervent
wish.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Perhaps this man has come along in the person of Frank E.
Kistler who has purchased the Osgood Estate and is busily engaged
restoring the property and making it into an all-year
resort. He has added 36 rooms to the already 40-room inn, built
a glass enclosed swimming pool, and constructed a children&rsquo;s
playground. He is selling home sites, erecting homes, building a
ski course, golf course, tennis courts, and minor auxiliary recreational
facilities.</p>
<p>Four miles below Redstone the Crystal River runs through
a district that contains several hot mineral springs that have medicinal
value comparable to any in the United States.</p>
<p>Soon the canyon widens, sometimes on one side, sometimes
on the other, into fertile meadows especially adapted to raising
strawberries, raspberries, cherries, and apples. A little farther on
there are large ranches bordering it. These raise potatoes, oats,
alfalfa, and hay; they all depend on the never failing Crystal
River for irrigation. It also runs through several stock (sheep and
cattle) ranches before it reaches the Roaring Fork River below
Carbondale, then, on to join the Colorado River below Glenwood
Springs, thence to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Citizens around Glenwood
Springs and Carbondale are all
anxious to see the toll road built
up the river as it would give them
another outlet to Crested Butte and
in fact all Gunnison County would
be benefitted by the construction
of the road.</p>
<p>Van Sycle &amp; Co. are having their
winter supplies packed up to their
mine on Avalanche Creek from
Carbondale. Their property is looking
fine.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Dec. 25, 1886</span></p>
<p>Not over 10 inches of snow in
camp. How&rsquo;s that for the 25th of
December?</p>
<p>Roads over the Pass (Schofield)
are blocked for the season and
snowshoe express is the only means
of getting anything into this neck
of the woods.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Jan. 15, 1887</span></p>
<p>About 18 inches of snow fell
around camp during our last storm.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">June 6, 1887</span></p>
<p>Wagons will go over the divide
(Schofield Pass) next week as the
snow has about all disappeared
through the timber.</p>
<p>The Crystal and Prospect mail
sack comes in chuck full these
days, making quite a load to be
packed over the divide on a man&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">June 18, 1887</span></p>
<p>The route down our valley from
Crested Butte to Carbondale and
Glenwood Springs is becoming
quite popular for those traveling
on horseback, as the distance is
considerable shorter and can be
made in about two days. If our
wagon road were only completed
there would be a large amount of
freighting done on this road and it
would not be long before the mail
route would be extended down the
valley.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">June 25, 1887</span></p>
<p>The first team went over the
divide (Schofield Pass) last Sunday.
The range is now cleared of
snow and we can expect to see
considerable travel this season.</p>
<p>Ashby has opened up a good
body of lead ore in the Crown
Point on Crystal Mountain. He has
been working this property since
1876.</p>
<p>A post office has been established
at Carbondale and W. M.
Dinkle appointed postmaster. This
is quite a convenience to the rapidly
growing town. The old Satank
(sometimes called Yellow Dog)
post office is now at Rockford
about two miles farther down the
valley.</p>

<p>The Board of County Commissioners
(Pitkin) met in special session
Monday. $800.00 was set
aside to build a road up the Crystal
River.&mdash;<i>Aspen Times.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sept. 10, 1887</span></p>
<p>50 coke ovens are to be erected
near Glenwood Springs. The coke
is to be made from coal at Jerome
Park.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sept. 17, 1887</span></p>
<p>The citizens of Glenwood Springs
contemplate holding a celebration
upon the arrival of the railroads.
The Denver &amp; Rio Grande (D&amp;RG)
is expected to reach the Springs
within the next two weeks, and the
Midland will not be far behind.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sept. 24, 1887</span></p>
<p>A most attractive feature of the
Midland railroad exhibit at the
Denver exposition are several marble
specimens which they obtained
from their claims on Yule Creek.
They have been polished in square
blocks. This exhibit will give visitors
an opportunity to see the valuable
resources of this district.</p>
<p>The wagon road up the Crystal
River from Carbondale is progressing
quite favorably and our citizens
are in hopes it will be completed
this fall.</p>
<h3 id="c11">THE MARBLE CITY TIMES and Clarence Chronicle</h3>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sept. 8, 1893</span></p>
<p>In the Little Jessie mine on Yule
Creek, there is from four to six
feet of lead ore exposd in the workings,
which runs well in lead and
silver. The ore body is opened up
in two places and shows up well.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Dec. 1, 1893</span></p>
<p>While over the range they are
struggling with from two to three
feet of snow, here we are having
pleasant weather and a scant two
inches of snow, which is thawing.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Jan. 5, 1894</span></p>
<p>The bid on the mail route between
Crested Butte and Gothic
went for $276 per annum&mdash;just $23
per month&mdash;barely enough to pay
for horse feed. Evidently some one
wants to walk and live on mountain
scenery. Speaking of mail contracts,
Allan Hodges did not get
his route by about $300. Some poor
hayseed is badly stuck.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Jan. 12, 1894</span></p>
<p>The Club held a special meeting
last night and unanimously decided
to offer Corbett and Mitchell
$75,000 each to have the fight
come off at Marble. In addition to
this they offered to give the contestants
a free ride on Tucker&rsquo;s
bicycle line and a body guard to
pass Cumming&rsquo;s place; a free bath
at the Hot Springs; free hot Scotch
at Leggetts, and a marble monument
to the one that gets killed.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Jan. 26, 1894</span></p>
<p>Marble failed to secure the Corbett-Mitchell
fight.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Feb. 23, 1894</span></p>
<p>Bud Fisher had a hard trip to
come from Crystal with the mail
Wednesday. He had to leave his
horse in the Canyon and walk to
town. The boys from the Silver
King shoveled the snow so as to
get the horse out and brought him
in about three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">March 16, 1894</span></p>
<p>The people of Carbondale are a
little excited over the discovery of
gold near there and up towards
Mount Sopris. We understand that
a large number of claims have already
been staked and that some
very promising rock is being shown
around town.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">April 4, 1894</span></p>
<p>A Coxey Army is talked of from
Marble. A great interest is being
taken by our people in the industrial
army.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
